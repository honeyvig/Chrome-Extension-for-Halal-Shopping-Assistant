-------------------
To create a Chrome Extension for the Halal Shopping Assistant, we'll break down the code into key components to meet the described functionality. The extension will scan products on e-commerce sites, identify Halal-certified items, suggest Halal alternatives, and allow users to manually check ingredients for Halal status.

Let's implement the following features step by step:
1. Manifest File (manifest.json)

This file defines the permissions, background scripts, and content scripts needed for the extension.

{
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "name": "The Halal Shopping Assistant",
  "version": "1.0",
  "description": "Helps Muslims identify Halal-certified products while shopping online",
  "permissions": [
    "activeTab",
    "storage",
    "https://www.googleapis.com/*",
    "https://www.amazon.com/*",
    "https://www.ebay.com/*",
    "https://www.walmart.com/*"
  ],
  "background": {
    "service_worker": "background.js"
  },
  "action": {
    "default_popup": "popup.html",
    "default_icon": {
      "16": "icons/icon16.png",
      "48": "icons/icon48.png",
      "128": "icons/icon128.png"
    }
  },
  "content_scripts": [
    {
      "matches": ["https://www.amazon.com/*", "https://www.ebay.com/*", "https://www.walmart.com/*"],
      "js": ["content.js"]
    }
  ],
  "host_permissions": [
    "http://*/*",
    "https://*/*"
  ]
}

2. Background Script (background.js)

This script handles logic such as database lookups, translating Halal ingredients, and managing user settings.

// background.js

// Example Halal, Haram, and Mashbooh ingredient database
const halalIngredients = ['chicken', 'beef', 'dates'];
const haramIngredients = ['pork', 'alcohol'];
const mashboohIngredients = ['gelatin', 'enzymes'];

// Mock function to verify ingredients
function checkHalalIngredients(ingredients) {
  const result = {
    halal: [],
    haram: [],
    mashbooh: []
  };

  ingredients.forEach(ingredient => {
    if (halalIngredients.includes(ingredient.toLowerCase())) {
      result.halal.push(ingredient);
    } else if (haramIngredients.includes(ingredient.toLowerCase())) {
      result.haram.push(ingredient);
    } else if (mashboohIngredients.includes(ingredient.toLowerCase())) {
      result.mashbooh.push(ingredient);
    }
  });

  return result;
}

// Listen for ingredient check requests
chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener((message, sender, sendResponse) => {
  if (message.action === 'checkIngredients') {
    const result = checkHalalIngredients(message.ingredients);
    sendResponse(result);
  }
});

3. Content Script (content.js)

This script scans product pages for ingredient information, checks certification, and displays Halal status.

// content.js

// Example logic to check product information on Amazon
function scanProductPage() {
  const productDescription = document.querySelector('#productDescription')?.innerText || '';
  const productTitle = document.querySelector('#productTitle')?.innerText || '';

  // Simulate finding ingredients in the product description
  const ingredients = extractIngredients(productDescription);

  // Send ingredients to background.js for checking
  chrome.runtime.sendMessage(
    { action: 'checkIngredients', ingredients: ingredients },
    (response) => {
      displayHalalStatus(response);
    }
  );
}

// Extract ingredients from product description (dummy function for now)
function extractIngredients(description) {
  const allIngredients = ['chicken', 'gelatin', 'beef', 'pork'];
  return allIngredients.filter(ingredient => description.toLowerCase().includes(ingredient));
}

// Display Halal status in the UI
function displayHalalStatus(halalStatus) {
  const badge = document.createElement('div');
  badge.style.position = 'absolute';
  badge.style.top = '10px';
  badge.style.right = '10px';
  badge.style.backgroundColor = 'green';
  badge.style.color = 'white';
  badge.style.padding = '5px';
  badge.style.borderRadius = '5px';

  if (halalStatus.haram.length > 0) {
    badge.innerText = 'Haram';
    badge.style.backgroundColor = 'red';
  } else if (halalStatus.mashbooh.length > 0) {
    badge.innerText = 'Mashbooh';
    badge.style.backgroundColor = 'orange';
  } else {
    badge.innerText = 'Halal';
    badge.style.backgroundColor = 'green';
  }

  document.body.appendChild(badge);
}

// Initiate scanning when the page is loaded
window.addEventListener('load', scanProductPage);

4. Popup HTML (popup.html)

This popup allows users to manually input ingredients and check their Halal status.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Halal Shopping Assistant</title>
  <style>
    body {
      font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
      padding: 10px;
    }
    input[type="text"] {
      width: 200px;
      padding: 5px;
    }
    button {
      padding: 5px;
      margin-top: 10px;
      background-color: #4CAF50;
      color: white;
      border: none;
      cursor: pointer;
    }
    button:hover {
      background-color: #45a049;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <h3>Check Ingredient for Halal Status</h3>
  <input type="text" id="ingredientsInput" placeholder="Enter ingredients" />
  <button id="checkButton">Check Halal Status</button>
  <div id="result"></div>

  <script>
    document.getElementById('checkButton').addEventListener('click', () => {
      const ingredients = document.getElementById('ingredientsInput').value.split(',');
      chrome.runtime.sendMessage(
        { action: 'checkIngredients', ingredients: ingredients },
        (response) => {
          const resultDiv = document.getElementById('result');
          if (response.haram.length > 0) {
            resultDiv.innerHTML = `<p style="color: red;">Haram: ${response.haram.join(', ')}</p>`;
          } else if (response.mashbooh.length > 0) {
            resultDiv.innerHTML = `<p style="color: orange;">Mashbooh: ${response.mashbooh.join(', ')}</p>`;
          } else {
            resultDiv.innerHTML = `<p style="color: green;">Halal: ${response.halal.join(', ')}</p>`;
          }
        }
      );
    });
  </script>
</body>
</html>

5. UI Design:

    Badges for Halal Status:
        Green: Halal
        Red: Haram
        Orange: Mashbooh (Doubtful)

6. Database (Example for Halal Ingredients Database)

You can either use a remote database or store the data locally. For simplicity, this code has a mock database (which you can expand).

    Halal, Haram, and Mashbooh ingredients can be updated dynamically based on user feedback and integration with Halal certification bodies.

7. Premium Features and Monetization

To implement the premium subscription model, you would use an external API (such as Stripe) to handle payments and user subscriptions. You can store user preferences, history, and premium status in Chrome's localStorage or a cloud database.
8. Handling Affiliate Links

For affiliate partnerships, you can include affiliate links in the suggestions for Halal alternatives, earning a commission when users make purchases through these links.
Conclusion:

This code gives you the foundation for the Halal Shopping Assistant Chrome extension with product scanning, Halal status checking, ingredient verification, and personalized suggestions. Key next steps include:

    Expanding ingredient databases.
    Integrating cloud storage for user preferences and subscription management.
    Developing a backend for managing affiliate partnerships and deals.
    Optimizing the extension for performance across multiple e-commerce sites.
